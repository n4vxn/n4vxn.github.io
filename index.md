- Migrated complex JSONB fields to normalized relational tables, significantly improving query performance, event-driven processing, and data integrity.
- Designed 30+ detailed ER diagrams for product features and internal tools, serving as blueprints for development, onboarding, and cross-functional planning.
- Led schema and data migration strategies, balancing top-down vs. bottom-up approaches, validating tooling, and ensuring consistency across staging and production environments.
- Collaborated with engineers by reviewing queries, optimizing database interactions, and suggesting structural improvements; documented architectural decisions to align all stakeholders.
- Developed a lightweight, stateless Slack bot in Go using Slack and Jira APIs to automate daily stand-ups, reduce manual friction, and enhance team accountability.
- Built custom Jira workflows with automation rules, integrating GitHub activity to streamline issue tracking, status updates, and repository coordination.
